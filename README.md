## Day Planner
This is a simple day planner that an updatable time table of the current day's business hours. The current date is displayed at the top of the page and the current time can be found at both the top of the time table and the bottom of the page. The application is fully responsive and will save any input to the event section when the buttons are pressed. The time table is color coded to the current time. Black rows represent the past, the green row is the current hour, and the blue rows are the future hours.

<!-- Should I put a key on the page to indicate what color things are meant to be? Will a grade be able to sort it out especially if they grade at night? -->

<!-- add a clear button -->
